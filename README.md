## Author: Thomas Stranick

## Description
The tech blog web app lets multiple users, when signed in, create and edit posts that they can share with other users. Users can create a login and then add posts to their dashboard which will display for all users on the homepage. These posts can be edited in case the user wants to change it. They can add comments to any post that a user creates. The user can then logout. This app utilizes sequelize to write users posts and comments to a database, as well as utilizes sessions to let users login and out.
